# Tuple (immutable/unchangeable)

1. A tuple is like a container where you can store multiple items, similar to a list.
2. It allows you to store multiple items (of the same or different data types) in a single variable, so we can say tuples are heterogeneous.
3. You cannot change what's inside a tuple after it is created (immutable), but you can access items using their position (index).
4. A tuple is one of the most efficient and commonly used data structures in Python.
5. Tuples are fixed in size, meaning their length cannot be changed once they are created.
6. You can create a tuple using parentheses () or the tuple() function.

# So, here are the names of the list methods:
count(), index(), len(), sum(), min(), max(), sorted()

# tuple operations: 
concatenation,repetition,membership,converts list to tuple,tuple unpacking, slicing, nested tuple accessing.
